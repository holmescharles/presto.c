# Tests

**Status: Broken / Not Maintained**

The test programs in this directory are outdated and may not compile against the current API.

## TODO

Consider adopting a lightweight C testing framework:

- [Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) - Single header, widely used
- [minunit](https://jera.com/techinfo/jtns/jtn002) - Minimal (~4 lines of macros)
- [greatest](https://github.com/silentbicycle/greatest) - Single header, TAP output

## Files

- `test_iterator.c` - Tests grab-style iterator API
- `debug_vars.c` - Lists variables in a BHV2 file
